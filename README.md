  <h1>Supplies Tracker</h1><br>
  
  
  
Tracks supplies (food, potions, teleports, ect.), Ammo (cannonballs included), runes, and weapons charges.

Farming supplies now tracked in update 1.7

To turn on weapon charges box (tracker will no longer add each individual item used for a charge), look in configs.

Blowpipe ammo used is not actual use. It is an estimate based on number of attacks.
